During the project, I learned to develop a fully functional Coffee Shop Website using HTML, 
CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I understood how to create a user-friendly interface, 
enable order customization, and integrate secure payment options. I also learned how to manage customer data and 
orders using NoSQL (MongoDB) and implement basic machine learning for personalized recommendations. The project gave
me hands-on experience with full-stack development, responsive design, and real-time data handling.
